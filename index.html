        <p> Chloe Turner, a culinary enthusiast turned tech aficionado. Originating from New York and currently residing in California.
            I embarked on a culinary journey, graduating from The Culinary Institute of America in 2021.
            Then spent years, honing my skills as a professional chef in Michelin star restaurants.
            However, my appetite for innovation led me to immerse myself in technology.
            Over the past two years, I’ve explored the realms of electrical engineering as well as both front-end and back-end programming.
            My passion extends beyond the kitchen—certified in Python for Data Science, AI, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript),
            I thrive on bridging the gap between culinary creativity and cutting-edge technology. Every skill acquired is a step toward transforming ideas into digital reality.
            Join me on this exciting expedition as I continuously grow, aiming not only to push technological boundaries but also to craft a unique blend of culinary and tech expertise.
             <br>Let’s create a digital world where flavors and code converge. </p>

         <h1> Robot Project</h1>
         <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/cbturner24/SchoolProjects/tree/main/LineCircleParse">Github Code</a><br>
           This program was made in C++ language. Using G-code I mapped out <br>
           three images on graphs. Then made the program randomly select one,<br>
           and the robot would proceed to draw out the image selected.<br>

    <h1>Tank Project</h1> 
   <p><a href="https://github.com/cbturner24/SchoolProjects/blob/main/Molassas.zip">Github Code</a><br>
        This program was made in VHDL language. <br>
       this is a program that will fill a liquid up in a tank<br>
        to a sensored level, stop, then fill other tank.<br>
